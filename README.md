# Script

## ticky_check.py
### Description
* The script should generate two different reports based on the ranking of errors generated by the system and the user usage statistics for the service
### Steps
* Import all the necessary Python modules that will be used in this Python script
* Initialize two empty dictionaries, one for the number of different error messages and another to count the number of entries for each user (splitting between INFO and ERROR)
* Open the file and iterate over each line to search for the pattern log. The pattern should matches the INFO or ERROR message formats. When there is a match, add one to the corresponding value in the per_user dictionary. If ERROR message occurs, also add one to the corresponding entry in the error dictionary.
* Sort both dictionaries. The error dictionary should be sorted by the number of errors from most common to least common.
The user dictionary should be sorted by username.
* Store both dictionaries into two different CSV files. The error_message csv file should has columns ('Error', 'Count'). The user_statistics csv file should has columns ('Username', 'INFO', 'ERROR').
